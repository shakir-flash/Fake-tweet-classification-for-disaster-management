### Fake Tweet Classification

Our approach involved a comprehensive classification of tweets, distinguishing between disaster-related and non-disaster-related content based on diverse metrics like keyword count, character count, and word count distributions. This meticulous analysis was instrumental in unraveling the nuances inherent in tweets during times of calamity, allowing for a more profound comprehension of their content and contextual relevance. To delve further into these insights, we constructed illuminating word clouds for both disaster and non-disaster tweets. These visual representations encapsulated the most prevalent words in each category, offering a vivid portrayal of the prevalent themes and discourse within the realm of calamitous events.

### Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, known as tokens. These tokens can be individual words or subwords, phrases, or even characters, depending on the specific tokenization technique used. The primary goal of tokenization is to facilitate natural language processing tasks by converting textual data into a format that can be easily handled by algorithms and models.

Utilizing the Tokenizer() function from the Keras library in Python, we meticulously tokenized our textual data with a specific vocabulary size set at 1000. The outcome of this process yielded a list of sequences, where each sequence encapsulated the transformation of textual content into a sequence of integers. This transformation paved the way for a structured and numerical representation of the textual information, laying the groundwork for subsequent analysis and modeling endeavors.

### BERT Model Implementation

BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a pre-trained language representation model developed by Google. It's designed to understand the context of words in a sentence by capturing bidirectional relationships in the text.

Key features of BERT:

1.  **Bidirectional Encoding:** BERT considers the full context of a word by looking at both the left and right context in all layers of the model. This bidirectional approach helps in understanding the nuances of language.

2.  **Pre-trained Model:** BERT is pre-trained on large corpora of text, learning to predict missing words in a sentence, which enables it to capture intricate relationships between words.

3.  **Fine-tuning:** BERT's pre-trained weights can be fine-tuned on specific tasks by adding additional layers or training it on domain-specific data. This allows BERT to be adapted to various natural language processing (NLP) tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, and more.

4.  **Embeddings:** BERT generates contextual word embeddings that capture the meaning of a word based on its context in a sentence. These embeddings are used as features for downstream NLP tasks.

We tried to implement a BERT-based binary classification model, achieving an accuracy of approximately 82% after three epochs. The BERT model is renowned for its contextual understanding and representation capabilities. Due to lack of computational resources we had to abort the model and moved ahead with a different approach.

### LSTM Model Exploration

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to handle the issue of vanishing or exploding gradients in traditional RNNs. LSTMs are capable of capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data by using a memory cell that can maintain information over long sequences.

Key features of LSTM:

1.  **Memory Cells:** LSTMs use memory cells to store information, which allows them to remember and access information from earlier time steps in a sequence.

2.  **Gates:** LSTMs contain three gates: input gate, forget gate, and output gate. These gates regulate the flow of information into and out of the memory cell, enabling the network to learn when to forget or update information.

3.  **Long-Term Dependencies:** LSTMs excel in capturing and retaining information over longer sequences, making them suitable for tasks involving sequential data like text, time series, speech, etc.

4.  **Training:** LSTMs are trained using backpropagation through time (BPTT) and can be optimized using various gradient descent algorithms like Adam, RMSprop, etc.

In response to resource limitations, we explored the implementation of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, achieving a commendable accuracy of around 80%. The LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network, demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing sequential dependencies in the data.

### Data Extraction from ntscraper

The Ntscraper library is a user-friendly tool tailored for effortless data retrieval from Nitter instances. It empowers users to extract tweets efficiently through a range of functionalities:

1.  **Search and Scraping Capabilities:** Easily locate and extract tweets containing specific terms or hashtags, streamlining the process of aggregating targeted content.

2.  **User Profile Scraping:** Seamlessly retrieve tweets from user profiles, enabling a focused exploration of individual user activity.

3.  **User Profile Information:** Fetch pertinent profile details like the display name, username, tweet count, and profile picture, offering comprehensive insights into user profiles.

Furthermore, in the absence of a specified instance, the scraper automatically selects a random public instance, ensuring a seamless scraping experience regardless of the instance availability.

Utilizing the robust capabilities of the ntscraper API, our initiative focused on extracting critical data related to distinct disaster topics, encompassing forest fires, floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes. By harnessing this API, we accessed real-time and contextually relevant information, significantly enriching the depth and breadth of our analysis.

### Geo-location Extraction

We used `spacy` and the geo-tagging entities of spacy nl model `en_core_web_sm` to identify the location of the tweets.

This strategic utilization empowered our project to stay dynamically aligned with ongoing events and swiftly gather comprehensive insights crucial for in-depth examination and effective disaster management strategies.

### GUI Interface Presentation (Streamlit)
